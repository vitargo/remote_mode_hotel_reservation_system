# Hotel reservation system

Task Description

The Java Development deliverable for this project is a back-end web service with endpoints that perform CRUD operations on three database tables:

- Users
- Rooms
- Reservations
The object of this system is to enable guests to create user accounts, search for rooms that meet their needs for accommodations and availability, request a reservation, and pay for a confirmed reservation. The system enables hotel managers to review and confirm the reservations and cancel any confirmed reservations not paid for within two days.
